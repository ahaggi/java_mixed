	//  public static native void yield()	NATIVE It marks a method, 
	//	that it will be implemented in other languages, not in Java. 
	//	It works together with JNI (Java Native Interface). 
	//	Native methods were used in the past to write performance critical sections 
	//	but with Java getting faster this is now less common. 
	//	Native methods are currently needed when You need to call a library from Java that is written 
	//	in other language. You need to access system or hardware resources that are only reachable
	//	from the other language (typically C). 
	//	Actually, many system functions that interact with real computer (disk and network IO, for instance) 
	//		can only do this because they call native code.
